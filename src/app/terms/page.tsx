      <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa.
        Disputes are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of South African
        courts, unless mandatory consumer protections provide otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes</h2>
